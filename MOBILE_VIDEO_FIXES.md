# Mobile Video Playback Fixes

## Issues Fixed

The video background was not playing properly on mobile devices due to several issues:

1. **Mobile Autoplay Restrictions**: Mobile browsers (especially iOS Safari) have strict autoplay policies
2. **Missing Mobile Attributes**: Video element was missing some mobile-specific attributes
3. **Poor Error Handling**: No fallback when video failed to load on mobile
4. **Touch Event Issues**: Video wasn't responding to touch events on mobile

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Updates (`index.html`)

- Added `webkit-playsinline` attribute for better iOS support
- Added `preload="metadata"` for faster mobile loading
- Added `poster` attribute for immediate visual feedback
- Updated video source URL to be more reliable

### 2. JavaScript Improvements (`assets/js/script.js`)

- **Mobile Detection**: Added device detection to handle mobile differently
- **Touch Event Handling**: Added touch event listeners for mobile video control
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with fallback to static image
- **Loading Optimization**: Added mobile-specific video loading optimizations
- **Timeout Handling**: Added 5-second timeout for mobile video loading

### 3. CSS Enhancements (`assets/css/style.css`)

- **Mobile Transform**: Added `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)` for better mobile performance
- **Touch Event Management**: Disabled pointer events on video, enabled on overlay
- **Mobile Sizing**: Ensured proper video container sizing on mobile
- **Performance Optimizations**: Added hardware acceleration and backface visibility

### 4. Mobile-Specific Features

- **Autoplay Fallback**: Shows static image if autoplay fails
- **Touch to Play**: Users can tap to start video if autoplay is blocked
- **Loading Indicators**: Better feedback during video loading
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback when video fails to load
